            <p>ConsenSys has been selected by European Commission to educate Members of the European Parliament about
                the blockchain technology. This mission is held by the European Union Blockchain Observatory and Forum,
                which runs a serie of workshops, conferences and reports.</p>
            <p>From the existing website developped by an external agency, I produced a consistent layout for 13 upcoming reports,
                regularly published during two years.</p>

                <p>For the first edition I worked more on the layout than the cover itself. Indeed, the layout would not change
                    for the upcoming serie of reports, instead of their covers, treating different topics.</p>

                <p>This project was a good occasion for me to use Processing: an environment of development based on Java to <b>design with code.</b></p>
                <p>A javascript version of Processing also exists, P5js, which might be handy for web projects.</p>

                <p>Going further in the <b>document management enhancement,</b> we took advantage of the power that a good
                    <b>filter tool</b> can provide. To avoid re-inventing the wheel on this, we kickstrarted with the same
                    structure as Stripe developped, and adapted it to our files classification.</p>
                <p>This huge <b>UX improvement</b> wouldn’t have been possible without upstream of having hierarchized all
                    operations-related types of documents within their relative categories. Sharing this schema with experts
                    in their field <b>let us streamline a UI</b> on which all companies could rely on, as a standard.</p>

                <p>This project drove me to produce <b>user-flow charts</b> on a regular basis to ensure a complete cover of
                    edge cases. I also had the opportunity to work on some PRD <b>(Product Requirement Document)</b> in
                    close collaboration with architects and business analysts to settle a design adapted to the technical
                    challenges.</p>

                <p>I started by <b>hand-draft ideas</b> based on current modal in production, alongside having <b>perfrom a benchmark</b> of best practices.</p>
                <p><b>After validation with the product owner</b> and other designers, I re-used components provided by the front-end library.</p>

                <p>Once most critical interaction issues were fixed and the design-debt cought-up, the backlog let us work on even better user experience, such as <b>contextual empty states.</b></p>
                <p>For this, I took in consideration the visual identity previously made by another studio, and played with abstract forms issued there to illustrate different specific context. <b>Work on copywriting and call to action</b> was also done.</p>

                <p>For my last design task on this project, I’ve been asked to join another scrum team to embed features of the platform as a <b>Outlook plugin.</b> After discussions with the tech lead and product owner, I was able to be <b>consistent with the web-based UI.</b> Thanks to the <b>Design system</b> we put in place with the design team, the integration was straight forward and fast.</p>
