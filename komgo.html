            <p>Among 50+ people dispatched within 5 scrum teams accross Europe, I joined the only designer
            at the time. I boarded the project when it had already some strong inertia (ongoing design debt)
            to manage. Catching up was done in a process of continuous improvement.</p>
            <p>I bridged the gap between the product owner and the developers of my scrum team in the following ways:
                • Design for all user-flows during the KYC (Know Your Customer) process, from scratch.
                • Ensured consistency of interaction patterns across various documents libraries. Considering different use cases per libraries, within the platform.
                • Conceived implementation of web-based features adapted into an Outlook plugin.</p>

                    <p>But first, we need to understand the bigger picture: how global trade finance works,
                        and where Blockchain technology comes into it wisely:</p>
                    <p>Komgo intervenes only in the financial aspect of the global commodity import/export activity.
                        The other parts, focused on the supply-chain are managed by another platform called Vakt.
                        The two platforms work alongside each others, a bit like the eBay/Paypal relationship
                        and have been launched in sync.</p>

                    <p>On top of the emptyness (and lack of empty states) of the platform, one of the most urgent
                        improvement I made was upon the documents types and category distinction.</p>
                    <p>After a quick benchmarking of document management systems (among competitors within the same
                        industry and more broadly) I drafted a lighter table to get rid of the generic accordion pattern
                        used by default by developpers.</p>
                    <p>Users were aware of the kind of documents they were expecting and how to classify them,
                        however they needed to find and manipulate them at a glance.</p>
