            <p>Among 50+ people dispatched within 5 scrum teams accross Europe, I joined the only designer
            at the time. I boarded the project when it had already some strong inertia (ongoing design debt)
            to manage. Catching up was done in a process of continuous improvement.</p>
            <p>I bridged the gap between the product owner and the developers of my scrum team in the following ways:
                • Design for all user-flows during the KYC (Know Your Customer) process, from scratch.
                • Ensured consistency of interaction patterns across various documents libraries. Considering different use cases per libraries, within the platform.
                • Conceived implementation of web-based features adapted into an Outlook plugin.</p>

                <p>But first, we need to understand the bigger picture: how global trade finance works, and where Blockchain technology comes into it wisely:</p>
                <p>Komgo intervenes only in the financial aspect of the global commodity import/export activity. The other parts, focused on the supply-chain are managed by another platform called Vakt. The two platforms work alongside each others, a bit like the eBay/Paypal relationship and have been launched in sync.</p>
                <p>Having this frame in mind and its level of complexity, we focused on prioritised smaller tasks with the Product Owner and the Business Analyst of my scrum team. We were designated to work on document management for KYC process, starting from the current state of the platform:</p>

          <div class="card">
            <div class="text">
              <p>On top of the emptyness (and lack of empty states) of the platform, one of the most urgent improvement I made was upon the <b>documents types and category</b> distinction.</p>
              <p>After a quick benchmarking of document management systems (among competitors within the same industry and more broadly) I drafted <b>a lighter table</b> to get rid of the generic accordion pattern used by default by developpers.</p>
              <p><b>Users</b> were aware of the kind of documents they <b>were expecting and how to classify them,</b> however they needed to find and manipulate them at a glance.</p>

                <p>Going further in the document management enhancement, we took advantage of the power that a good filter tool can provide. To avoid re-inventing the wheel on this, we kickstrarted with the same structure as Stripe developped, and adapted it to our files classification.</p>
